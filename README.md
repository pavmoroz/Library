"Library" is a desktop application which presents basic CRUD operations on a database using such
technologies as: Java SE, Java Swing, Java JDBC and Oracle DB.

Right after running, you will see the main screen with general information about
the books stored in the DB and two buttons: "Create" and "Delete" which allow us to insert and delete books
respectively. Also, in this library you can update price of the book, so by double-clicking on a price area,
you are permitted to do that.
Data validation of user input was also provided, so it will be impossible for user 
to add a new book using wrong path to cover, non-numeric price, already existing book etc.

In order to show how this program is working, Embedded Derby Database was added and some initial values were hard coded.
